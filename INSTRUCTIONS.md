# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your Flask application to GitHub:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to github.com and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
   - Select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "flask-user-form")
   - Leave it public or make it private as per your preference
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Initialize Git and push your code (run these commands in your terminal):
```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## What's included
The repository is already set up with:
- `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- `README.md` with project documentation
- All necessary application files

## After deployment
After pushing to GitHub, you can:
1. Enable GitHub Pages if you want to show the documentation
2. Add collaborators if working with a team
3. Set up branch protection rules if needed
