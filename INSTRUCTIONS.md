# GitHub Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy your Flask application to GitHub:

1. First, create a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:
   - Go to github.com and sign in
   - Click your profile picture → Settings
   - Scroll down to "Developer settings" (bottom of left sidebar)
   - Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Flask App Deployment")
   - Select scopes: at minimum, check "repo"
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy your token immediately and save it somewhere safe. You won't be able to see it again!

2. Now, when pushing to GitHub, use your token as the password:
```bash
# First, configure Git to use HTTPS
git config --global credential.helper store

# Then set up your remote (replace with your details)
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# When you push, use your token as the password
git push -u origin main
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

## What's included
The repository is already set up with:
- `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files
- `README.md` with project documentation
- All necessary application files

## After deployment
After pushing to GitHub, you can:
1. Enable GitHub Pages if you want to show the documentation
2. Add collaborators if working with a team
3. Set up branch protection rules if needed
